# mintMenu_SearchLaunch
A script that finds and launches applications designed for Linux Mint MATE's mintMenu.

Its goal is to save time when rapidly searching for an application in mintMenu by launching the most relevant application when the user presses Enter. It also can be used separately from the command-line by typing the query as its arguments, and it may work for other application menus.
## Installation
Download the .sh file and save it preferably under your home directory, and give it executable permissions. Then, right-click on mintMenu's Menu button and go to Preferences. Under the Applications tab you will find a 'Search command' text box. Replace the existing text with `bash /path/to/mintMenu_SearchLaunch.sh %s` and hit Close.
